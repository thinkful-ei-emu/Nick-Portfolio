                <article>
                    I started my working life working in food service and screen-printing. Working in 
                    screen-printing allowed me to develop a strong attention to detail, a need to be organized, 
                    and an ability to solve problems in creative ways. It also gave me an appreciation for good design. 
                    While my experience in food service made me humble and instilled a solid work ethic that I carry 
                    with me into each project I’m a part of. My hope is to work in a way that makes people’s lives easier. 
                    There are so many tools and apps that can be made that could benefit everyone and that idea is very 
                    motivating for me.
                    When I’m not coding you can find me playing the drums in a band with some of my best friends.
                    I’ve been passionate about the drums for the greater portion of my life and spend a lot of 
                    my free time practicing. I look forward to talking about coding and music with you!

                    application utilizes an api to store and retrieve user data. Users will also enjoy the ability to
